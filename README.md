CloudSpokes: Argh! Pirate Chatter
=============

Challenge
-------

### Overview

Our second favorite day of the year at CloudSpokes is International Talk Like A Pirate Day (September 19th). Since ITLAP Day falls this year in the middle of Dreamforce, we thought it would be fun to write an app that "piratizes your chatter posts". 

How much fun would it be to have the SVP of Sales in your organization post to chatter:

  "Hey Jim!! Do you want to meet with the customer for lunch?"

and it shows up as:

  Ahoy Jim!! Do ye wants t' meet wit' th' customer fer grub?

There are a ton of ideas that you can use for inspiration this one, pirate lingo or pirate translations. 

### Challenge Requirements

In a new DE org create an app that "piratizes" any Chatter post or reply. Be as creative with the process, text that is posted, etc. The more fun the merrier!

There must be a setting that turns "pirate chatter" on or off org-wide.

Must have 90%+ test coverage.

Instructions
-------

1. Zip up the contents of talklikeapirate folder and upload to your org via the workbench.
2. Goto Setup -> App Setup -> Develop -> Custom Settings -> Talk Like a Pirate -> Manage -> Edit to enable and disable the feature.
